This workshop is set out to critically identify risks and limitations in
AI-powered technologies while fostering reflection on their development and impact through the use of structured co-design methodologies. The workshop aims to
bring together diverse contributions and practices to explore how participatory processes can integrate community values into the co-design of socio-technical systems. Through a combination of talks, roundtable discussions, and hands-on activities, participants will collaborate to produce actionable outputs such as guidelines,
a white paper, or design artifacts. The event ultimately intends to foster interdisciplinary engagement and move beyond academia to include practitioners, NGOs, and designers, experimenting a robust, society-centered approach to AI development, assessment, and deploymen
