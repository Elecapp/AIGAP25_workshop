## Mind the AI-GAP 2025: Co-Designing Socio-Technical Systems 

### Colocated with <a href="https://hhai-conference.org/2025/" target="_blank">HHAI 2025</a>: The 4th International Conference Series on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (June 9-13, 2025 in Pisa, Italy)

This workshop is set out to critically identify risks and limitations in AI-powered technologies while fostering reflection on their development and impact through the use of structured co-design methodologies. It aims to bring together diverse contributions and practices to explore how participatory processes can integrate community values into the co-design of socio-technical systems. Through a combination of talks, roundtable discussions, and hands-on activities, participants will collaborate to produce actionable outputs such as guidelines, a white paper, or design artifacts. The event ultimately intends to foster interdisciplinary engagement and move beyond academia to include practitioners, NGOs, and designers, experimenting a robust, society-centered approach to AI development, assessment, and deployment.
